# *NOTES*
# The `__init__.py` file in the `migrations` directory is used to mark the directory as a Python package.
# This is required so that Python recognizes the `migrations` directory as a package and can properly import migration modules.
# https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages

# In Django, the `migrations` package contains migration files that manage changes to the database schema over time.
# Each migration file is a Python script that describes changes to the database schema, such as creating or altering tables.
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/migrations/

# Typically, the `__init__.py` file in the `migrations` directory is empty, as its primary purpose is to indicate that the directory is a package.
# No additional initialization code is usually required in this file.
