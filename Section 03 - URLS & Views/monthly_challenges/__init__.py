# *NOTES*
# The `__init__.py` file is used to mark a directory as a Python package.
# This allows Python to import modules from this directory.
# It can also be used to execute initialization code for the package.
# https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages

# In this particular case, the file is empty, indicating that no specific initialization is needed for the `monthly_challenges` package.
# However, it is still necessary to include this file to ensure the `monthly_challenges` directory is recognized as a package.
