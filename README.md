* All Notes will have the following format:

```python
# *NOTES*
# Notes go here for the code. I will start by giving
# an explanation of the code and then putting any
# relevant document links or articles below the notes.
# https://www.relevant-link-1.com
# https://www.relevant-link-2.com
```

* I will not duplicate notes from earlier sections into future sections, unless it is necessary.
* In the first coding section "Section 3 - Urls & Views", I go over every line of code in all of the project files, for completeness.
